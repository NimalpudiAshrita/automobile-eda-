** Automobile Data Analysis (EDA Project)
**
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of an automobile dataset to understand how different vehicle features affect pricing, performance, and efficiency. The analysis explores relationships between attributes such as engine size, horsepower, fuel type, body style, and price.

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in data cleaning, visualization, and extracting meaningful insights from real-world automobile data. This project does not involve machine learning models and is purely analysis-focused.
